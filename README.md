# OS-Backup-for-Raspbery
### Description
This script help you to know in which disk you can make a backup of your Raspbian OS.

### My problem
I usually use Piclone to make a backup of my Raspbian OS. When we execute this program, the source disk is clear (/dev/mmcblk0), but the destination disk not so.
